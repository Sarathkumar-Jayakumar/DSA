* What is an algorithm?

 - An algorithm is a set of instructions to perform a task or to solve a given problem
 
 - Example: A recipe book with list of recipies which has the step by step instructions for preparing food. 
 
 - Example Problem: Print average of 3 given numbers
   
  - Algorithm for above problem:
   - Perform sum of 3 numbers
   - Store it in a variable sum
   - Divide the sum by 3
   - Store the value in a variable avg
   - Print the value stored in avg
   
  Solution: 
   
  public void findAvg(int a, int b, int c) {

		int sum = a + b + c;

		int avg = sum / 3;

		System.out.println(avg);
